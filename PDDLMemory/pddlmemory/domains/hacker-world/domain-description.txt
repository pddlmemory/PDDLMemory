The hacker-world domain represents a world in which a hacker (mallory) has to gain access to different services that can be accessed by non-hackers (alice and bob). In order to do so, he has to first find/eat enough pizza. The initial domain was created as part of the MyPDDL package. It was later adapted and modeled using the PDDLMemory SublimeText plugin.
