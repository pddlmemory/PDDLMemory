v0.1.1.

* Planning time in the CSV output produced by bin/memoplan_csv is 0.00s if
no plan has been found. Should be fixed in pddlmemory/launcher.py. (by measuring
planner execution time) 
Currently the planning time is obtained by the parser. The planner (ff) outputs a 
"time spent" line if a plan has been found. No output is produced if no plan
has been found, so the planning time is set to 0.00s by default.
